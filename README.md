Create and test a class Basket
#Add a class/static variable pricelist of type dictionary
#Add a data structure to store the individual basket contents - the quantities of each item being purchased
#create a method to add an item with a given quantity to the basket
#create a method value to return the cost of the basket contents
#Test that:
#the value is zero on creation
#Value is correct after adding one item
#Value is correct after adding more of one item (quantity >1)
Value is correct after adding even more of one item (two calls to add method)
#Value is correct after adding some additional items of another product
#Cannot add a negative quantity (Error)
#Cannot add something not in the pricelist (Should give a ValueError!)
